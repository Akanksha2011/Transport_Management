# Vaahan Wallah

Vaahan Wallah is a sophisticated time-based CLI simulator developed in Java, leveraging our strong grasp of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Featuring a diverse range of vehicles, this project demonstrates our program's potential for future expansions. It not only showcases our technical prowess but also highlights our team's collaborative spirit and dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions.

## Learnings 

Developed as a CLI project in Java, Vaahan Wallah is a testament to our team's proficiency in OOP and our commitment to showcasing our knowledge and skills. Through this project, we gained invaluable insights into designing and animating terminal interfaces and implementing various OOP concepts, including:

**Abstraction:** Utilized to hide complex implementation details and provide a simplified interface for users.
**Encapsulation:** Ensured data security by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data, preventing direct access from outside the class.
**Hierarchical Inheritance:** Implemented a class structure where multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class, facilitating code reuse and specialization.
**File Handling (as the database):** Managed persistent data storage and retrieval using file operations, providing a structured approach to store application data.

By combining our technical expertise with effective teamwork, we have successfully built a robust and feature-rich simulator.

By seamlessly integrating OOP principles into the design and implementation of Vaahan Wallah, we achieved a modular and extensible codebase. This approach facilitates easy maintenance, scalability, and the addition of new features.

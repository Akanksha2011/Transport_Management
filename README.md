Lessons Learned
Developed as a CLI project in C++, Vaahan Wallah is a testament to our team's proficiency in OOP and our commitment to showcasing our knowledge and skills. Through this project, we gained invaluable insights into designing and animating terminal interfaces and implementing various OOP concepts, including:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Hierarchical Inheritance
File Handling (as the database)
By seamlessly integrating OOP principles into the design and implementation of Vaahan Wallah, we achieved a modular and extensible codebase. This approach facilitates easy maintenance, scalability, and the addition of new features.
